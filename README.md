For mars rover The time complexity is a for loop that runs first n/3 times, and then another for loop that runs n times, which makes the runtime O(n)
The space complexity is O(1) because for any size input, there is only one string made, and one integer made
For Two Strings, it starts with an empty string and finds every permutation of string 1 to see which of them are contained in s2. It failed many of the tests when submitted because of how slow it is. The first few test cases work though.
